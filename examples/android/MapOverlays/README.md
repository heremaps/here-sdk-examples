The MapOverlays example app shows how to pin a native Android view to the map. You can find how this is done in [MapOverlayExample.java](guides/android/markdown/en-US/examples/MapOverlays/app/src/main/java/com/here/sdk/mapoverlays/MapOverlayExample.java).

Build instructions:
-------------------

1) Copy the AAR file of the HERE SDK for Android to your app's app/libs folder.

Note: If your AAR version is different than the version shown in the user guide, you may need to adapt the source code of the example app.

2) Open Android Studio and sync the project.

Please do not forget: To run the app, you need to add your HERE SDK credentials to the AndroidManifext.xml file. More information can be found in the "Get Started"-section of the user guide.
