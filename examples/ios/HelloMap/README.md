The HelloMap example app shows how the HERE SDK can be integrated into your project and how to display a map.

Build instructions:
-------------------

1) Copy the heresdk.framework file to your app's root folder.

2) In Xcode, open the General settings of the App target and make sure that the HERE SDK framework appears under Embedded Binaries. If it does not appear, add the heresdk.framework to the Embedded Binaries section ("Add other..." -> "Create folder references").
