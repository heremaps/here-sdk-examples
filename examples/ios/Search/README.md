The Search example app shows how to search for places including auto suggestions, for the address that belongs to certain geographic coordinates (_reverse geocoding_) and for the geographic coordinates that belong to an address (_geocoding_). You can find how this is done in [SearchExample.swift](Search/SearchExample.swift).

Build instructions:
-------------------

1) Copy the heresdk.framework file to your app's root folder.

2) In Xcode, open the General settings of the App target and make sure that the HERE SDK framework appears under Embedded Binaries. If it does not appear, add the heresdk.framework to the Embedded Binaries section ("Add other..." -> "Create folder references").
