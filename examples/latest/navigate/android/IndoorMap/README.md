The Indoor Map example app shows how to display private venues on a map view and how to interact with them. Venues are tied to your credentials. Talk to your HERE representative to provide your venue data and enable your venue data on the map. By default, no venues are shown on the map, but you can enable your private venues for your set of credentials.

Build instructions:
-------------------

1) Copy the AAR file of the HERE SDK for Android to your app's `app/libs` folder.

Note: If your AAR version is different than the version shown in the _Developer's Guide_, you may need to adapt the source code of the example app.

2) Open Android Studio and sync the project.

Please do not forget: To run the app, you need to add your HERE SDK credentials to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. More information can be found in the _Get Started_ section of the _Developer's Guide_.
