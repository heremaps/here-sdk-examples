The HelloMapAndroidAuto example app shows how [Android Auto](https://www.android.com/auto/) can be integrated into your app using the HERE SDK to display a map view on Android's DHU.

Android Auto is only compatible with phones running Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher.

Build instructions:
-------------------

1) Copy the AAR file of the HERE SDK for Android to your app's `app/libs` folder.

Note: If your AAR version is different than the version shown in the _Developer's Guide_, you may need to adapt the source code of the example app.

2) Open Android Studio and sync the project.

3) Check the _Android Auto_ section in the _Developer's Guide_ on how to start Android's DHU.

Please do not forget: To run the app, you need to add your HERE SDK credentials to the `MainActivity.java` file. More information can be found in the _Get Started_ section of the _Developer's Guide_.
