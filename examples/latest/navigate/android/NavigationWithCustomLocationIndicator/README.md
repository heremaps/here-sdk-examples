The NavigationWithCustomLocationIndicator example app shows how the HERE SDK can be set up to 
navigate to a location with a custom LocationIndicator. It shows usage of the default pedestrian / navigate LocationIndicator
assets. On top, the app shows how to customize the guidance view by setting custom zoom level and tilt.

Build instructions:
-------------------

1) Copy the AAR file of the HERE SDK for Android to your app's `app/libs` folder.

Note: If your AAR version is different than the version shown in the _Developer's Guide_, you may need to adapt the source code of the example app.

2) Open Android Studio and sync the project.

Please do not forget: To run the app, you need to add your HERE SDK credentials to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. More information can be found in the _Get Started_ section of the _Developer's Guide_.
