**This folder contains precompiled HERE SDK Units for easy use in your apps.**

* All units must be built and provided in the **release** build variant.
* When you change a unit, add the rebuilt library (AAR) to this folder for quick reference.
* For any meaningful change, **bump the unit’s version**. 
  * Set the version in the unit’s `build.gradle` under `defaultConfig` as `versionName`.
