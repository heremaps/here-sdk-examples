The Camera example app shows how to animate from one location to another. You can find how this is done in [CameraExample.dart](lib/CameraExample.dart).

Build instructions:
-------------------

1) Set your HERE SDK credentials to
- `hello_map/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- `hello_map/ios/Runner/Info.plist`

2) Unzip the HERE SDK plugin to the plugins folder inside this project. Name the folder 'here_sdk': hello_map/plugins/here_sdk

3) Start an emulator or simulator and execute `flutter run` from the app's directory - or run the app from within your IDE.

More information can be found in the _Get Started_ section of the _Developer's Guide_.
