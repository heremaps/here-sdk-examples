This example app shows how the HERE SDK can be set up to navigate to a location with a custom `LocationIndicator`. It shows usage of the default pedestrian / navigate `LocationIndicator`
assets. On top, the app shows how to customize the guidance view by setting custom zoom level and tilt.

Build instructions:
-------------------

1) Set your HERE SDK credentials to
- `navigation_custom/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- `navigation_custom/ios/Runner/Info.plist`

2) Unzip the HERE SDK plugin to the plugins folder inside this project. Name the folder 'here_sdk': `navigation_custom/plugins/here_sdk`.

3) Start an emulator or simulator and execute `flutter run` from the app's directory - or run the app from within your IDE.
