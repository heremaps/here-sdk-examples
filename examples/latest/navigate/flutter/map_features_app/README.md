The map_features_app example app demonstrates how to load and switch between various map schemes, enable specialized map features allowing you to overlay extra content on the map, such as 3D landmarks, onto the map and toggle between Globe and Web Mercator map projections. You can find how this is done in [MapFeaturesExample.dart](lib/MapFeaturesExample.dart) and [MapSchemesExample.dart](lib/MapSchemesExample.dart). 

Build instructions:
-------------------

1) Set your HERE SDK credentials programmatically in `lib/main.dart`.

2) Unzip the HERE SDK plugin to the plugins folder inside this project. Name the folder 'here_sdk': `plugins/here_sdk`.

3) Start an emulator or simulator and execute `flutter run` from the app's directory - or run the app from within your IDE.
