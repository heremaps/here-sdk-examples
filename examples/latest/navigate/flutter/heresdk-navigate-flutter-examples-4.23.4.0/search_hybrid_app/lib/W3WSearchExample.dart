 * The W3WSearchExample class demonstrates the use of the W3WSearchEngine
 * to perform operations with what3words terms.
 *
 * With the W3WSearchEngine, you can:
 * - Resolve a what3words term to an address and geographic coordinates.
 * - Find a what3words term for given geographic coordinates.
 *
 * Both approaches are demonstrated in the examples below.
 * The W3WSearchEngine interacts with the https://what3words.com/ backend
 * to perform these operations.
