The Traffic example app shows how to toggle traffic flow and traffic incidents visualization on a map and how to use the TrafficEngine to query such data in realtime, for example, along a route. You can find how this is done in [TrafficExample.dart](lib/TrafficExample.dart) and [RoutingExample.dart](lib/RoutingExample.dart).
