 * The DistanceAccuracyLocationFilter class implements the LocationFilterAbstract and provides a filtering strategy based on accuracy
 * and distance from last accepted location. This class works on two filter mechanisms.
 * AccuracyFilter - Filters the location data based on the accuracy of the GPS readings, and only includes the readings with a certain level of accuracy.
 * DistanceFilter - Filters the location data based on the locations that are within the specified distance from the last accepted location.
