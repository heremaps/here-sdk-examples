The Search example app shows how to search for places including autosuggestions, for the address that belongs to certain geographic coordinates (_reverse geocoding_) and for the geographic coordinates that belong to an address (_geocoding_). You can find how this is done in [SearchExample.dart](lib/SearchExample.dart).

Build instructions:

2) Unzip the HERE SDK plugin to the plugins folder inside this project. Name the folder 'here_sdk': `plugins/here_sdk`.

3) Start an emulator or simulator and execute `flutter run` from the app's directory - or run the app from within your IDE.
