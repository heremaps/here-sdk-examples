The carto_poi_picking example app shows how the HERE SDK can be used to pick embedded POI, vehicle restrictions & traffic incidents.

Build instructions:
-------------------

1) Set your HERE SDK credentials programmatically in `lib/main.dart`.

2) Unzip the HERE SDK plugin to the plugins folder inside this project. Name the folder 'here_sdk': `carto_poi_picking/plugins/here_sdk`.

3) Start an emulator or simulator and execute `flutter run` from the app's directory - or run the app from within your IDE.
