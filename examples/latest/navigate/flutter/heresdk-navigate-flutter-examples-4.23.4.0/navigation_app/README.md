The Navigation example app shows how to calculate a route from A to B and how to start turn-by-turn navigation. You can find how this is done in [NavigationExample.dart](lib/NavigationExample.dart).

Build instructions:
-------------------

1) Set your HERE SDK credentials programmatically in `lib/main.dart`.

2) Unzip the HERE SDK plugin to the plugins folder inside this project. Name the folder 'here_sdk': `plugins/here_sdk`.

3) Start an emulator or simulator and execute `flutter run` from the app's directory - or run the app from within your IDE.
