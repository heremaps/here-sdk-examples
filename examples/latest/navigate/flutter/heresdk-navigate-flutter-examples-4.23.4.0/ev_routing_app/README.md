The EVRouting example app shows how the HERE SDK can be used to calculate routes for electric vehicles and how to calculate the area of reach with isoline routing.

Build instructions:
-------------------

1) Set your HERE SDK credentials programmatically in `lib/main.dart`.

2) Unzip the HERE SDK plugin to the plugins folder inside this project. Name the folder 'here_sdk': `plugins/here_sdk`.

3) Start an emulator or simulator and execute `flutter run` from the app's directory - or run the app from within your IDE.
