This example app shows how to load custom maps that have been made with the [HERE Style Editor](https://platform.here.com/style-editor/). Note that this requires HERE SDK 4.12.1.0 or higher. You can find how this is done in [CustomMapStylesExample.swift](CustomMapStylesExample/CustomMapStylesExample.swift).

Build instructions:
-------------------

1) Copy the `heresdk.xcframework` folder (as found in the HERE SDK package) to your app's root folder.

Note: If your framework version is different than the version shown in the _Developer Guide_, you may need to adapt the source code of the example app.

2) Open Xcode by double-clicking the `*.xcodeproj` file.

Note: In Xcode, open the _General_ settings of the _App target_ and make sure that the HERE SDK framework appears under _Embedded Binaries_. If it does not appear, add the `heresdk.framework` to the _Embedded Binaries_ section ("Add other..." -> "Create folder references").

Please do not forget: To run the app, you need to add your HERE SDK credentials to the `CustomMapStylesApp.swift` file of your project. More information can be found in the _Get Started_ section of the _Developer Guide_.
