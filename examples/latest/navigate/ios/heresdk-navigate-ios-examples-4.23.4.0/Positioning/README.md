The Positioning example app shows how to use the location engine to visualize your current location on a map. You can find how this is done in [PositioningExample.swift](Positioning/PositioningExample.swift).

Build instructions:
-------------------

1) Copy the `heresdk.xcframework` folder (as found in the HERE SDK package) to your app's root folder.

2) In Xcode, open the General settings of the App target and make sure that the HERE SDK framework appears under Embedded Binaries. If it does not appear, add the heresdk.framework to the Embedded Binaries section ("Add other..." -> "Create folder references").

Please do not forget: To run the app, you need to add your HERE SDK credentials to the `PositioningApp.swift` file of your project. More information can be found in the _Get Started_ section of the _Developer Guide_.
