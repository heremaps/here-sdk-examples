The MapItems example app shows how to pin images and 3D objects to mark specific spots on the map. You can find how this is done in [MapItemsExample.java](app/src/main/java/com/here/mapitems/MapItemsExample.java).

Build instructions:
-------------------

1) Copy the AAR file of the HERE SDK for Android to your app's `app/libs` folder.

Note: If your AAR version is different than the version shown in the _Developer's Guide_, you may need to adapt the source code of the example app.

2) Open Android Studio and sync the project.

Please do not forget: To run the app, you need to add your HERE SDK credentials to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. More information can be found in the _Get Started_ section of the _Developer's Guide_.
