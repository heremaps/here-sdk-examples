This example app shows how to load custom maps that have been made with the [HERE Style Editor](https://platform.here.com/style-editor/). Note that this requires HERE SDK 4.12.1.0 or higher. You can find how this is done in [CustomMapStyleExample.dart](lib/CustomMapStyleExample.dart).

Build instructions:
-------------------

1) Set your HERE SDK credentials programmatically in `lib/main.dart`.

2) Unzip the HERE SDK plugin to the plugins folder inside this project. Name the folder 'here_sdk': `plugins/here_sdk`.

3) Start an emulator or simulator and execute `flutter run` from the app's directory - or run the app from within your IDE.

More information can be found in the _Get Started_ section of the _Developer's Guide_.
