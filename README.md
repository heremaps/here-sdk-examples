# HERE SDK - Examples
The HERE SDK enables you to build powerful map applications and it is available for _Android_ and _iOS_. Bundled along with it are many of HEREâ€™s assets, available for customers to integrate with their own apps. The HERE SDK consumes data from HERE's Open Location Platform (OLP) and gives you instant access to the freshest map data of the highest quality, consistency and accuracy.
