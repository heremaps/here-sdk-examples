# HERE SDK - Examples for Android and iOS
The new HERE SDK enables you to build powerful location-aware applications. Explore maps that are fast and smooth to interact with, pan/zoom across map views of varying resolutions, and enable the display of various elements such as routes and POIs on highly customizable map views.

The HERE SDK is consuming [Open Location Platform](https://developer.here.com/products/open-location-platform) (OLP) data and it is following modern design principles incorporating microservices and highly modularized components. Currently, the HERE SDK supports two platforms, Android and iOS.

For an overview of the existing features, please check our _Developer's Guide_:
- [HERE SDK for Android: Developer's Guide](https://developer.here.com/documentation/android-sdk/dev_guide/index.html)
- [HERE SDK for iOS: Developer's Guide](https://developer.here.com/documentation/ios-sdk/dev_guide/index.html)

## List of Available Example Apps
In this repo you can find the latest example apps that show key features of the HERE SDK in ready-to-use applications:

- **HelloMap** ([Android](examples/android/HelloMap) |[iOS](examples/ios/HelloMap)): Shows the classic 'Hello World'.
- **HelloMapWithStoryboard** ([iOS](examples/ios/HelloMapWithStoryboard)): Shows the classic 'Hello World' using a Storyboard.
- **Gestures** ([Android](examples/android/Gestures) | [iOS](examples/ios/Gestures)): Shows how to handle gestures.
- **MapMarker** ([Android](examples/android/MapMarker) | [iOS](examples/ios/MapMarker)): Shows how to add POI marker to the map.
- **MapObjects** ([Android](examples/android/MapObjects) | [iOS](examples/ios/MapObjects)): Shows how to add circles, polygones and polylines to the map.
- **MapOverlays** ([Android](examples/android/MapOverlays) | [iOS](examples/ios/MapOverlays)): Shows how to add standard platform views to the map.
- **Routing** ([Android](examples/android/Routing) | [iOS](examples/ios/Routing)): Shows how to calculate routes and add them to the map.
- **Search** ([Android](examples/android/Search) | [iOS](examples/ios/Search)): Shows how to search POIs and add them to the map.
- **Traffic** ([Android](examples/android/Traffic) | [iOS](examples/ios/Traffic)): Shows how to search for real-time traffic and how to visualize it on the map.
- **StandAloneEngine** ([Android](examples/android/StandAloneEngine) | [iOS](examples/ios/StandAloneEngine)): Shows how to use the HERE SDK headless without setting hardcoded credentials.

Each example app contains a file named "XY-Example" where XY stands for the feature, which is in most cases equal to the name of the app. If you are looking for example code that shows how to use a certain HERE SDK feature, then please look for this file as it contains all the details.

## What You Need
1. Acquire a set of credentials by registering yourself on [developer.here.com](https://developer.here.com/) - or ask your HERE representative.
2. Download the latest HERE SDK framework artifact for your desired platform. It can be found on [developer.here.com](https://developer.here.com/).
3. Please refer to the minimum requirements as listed in our _Developer's Guide_ for [Android](https://developer.here.com/documentation/android-sdk/dev_guide/topics/quick-start.html#minimum-requirements) and [iOS](https://developer.here.com/documentation/ios-sdk/dev_guide/topics/quick-start.html#minimum-requirements).

> All examples apps work with the latest HERE SDK for Android and iOS, **Version 4.1.1.0**.

## Get Started for Android
1. Copy the AAR file of the HERE SDK for Android to your app's `app/libs` folder.
2. Open _Android Studio_ and sync the project.

Please do not forget: To run the app, you need to add your HERE SDK credentials to the `AndroidManifext.xml` file. More information can be found in the _Get Started_-section of the _Developer's Guide_.

## Get Started for iOS
1. Copy the `heresdk.framework` file of the HERE SDK for iOS to your app's root folder.
2. In Xcode, open the _General_ settings of the app target and make sure that the HERE SDK framework appears under _Embedded Binaries_. If it does not appear, add the `heresdk.framework` to the _Embedded Binaries_ section ("Add other..." -> "Create folder references").

Please do not forget: To run the app, you need to add your HERE SDK credentials to the `Info.plist` file. More information can be found in the _Get Started_-section of the _Developer's Guide_.
