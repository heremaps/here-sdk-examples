## About the HERE SDK

The [HERE SDK](https://developer.here.com/products/here-sdk) enables you to build powerful location-aware applications. Explore maps that are fast and smooth to interact with, pan/zoom across map views of varying resolutions, and enable the display of various elements such as routes and POIs on highly customizable map views.

The HERE SDK consumes data from the [HERE Platform](https://www.here.com/products/platform) and follows modern design principles incorporating microservices and modularized components. Currently, the HERE SDK supports three platforms: Android, iOS and Flutter.

For an overview of the existing features, please check the _Developer's Guide_ for the platform of your choice. Here you will also find numerous code snippets, detailed tutorials, the _API Reference_ and the latest _Release Notes_:

Most example apps contain a class named "XY-Example" where XY stands for the feature, which is in most cases equal to the name of the app. If you are looking for example code that shows how to use a certain HERE SDK feature, then please look for this class as it contains the most interesting parts. Note that the overall app architecture is kept as simple as possible to not shadow the parts in focus.

3. Please refer to the minimum requirements and supported devices as listed in our _Developer's Guide_.

### Get Started for Android
1. Copy the AAR file of the HERE SDK for Android to the example app's `app/libs` folder.
2. Open _Android Studio_ and sync the project.
3. To run the app, you need to add your HERE SDK credentials to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file.

### Get Started for iOS
1. Copy the `heresdk.framework` file of the HERE SDK for iOS to the example app's root folder.
2. To run the app, you need to add your HERE SDK credentials to the `Info.plist` file.

### Get Started for Flutter
