## About the HERE SDK

The [HERE SDK](https://developer.here.com/products/here-sdk) enables you to build powerful location-aware applications. Explore maps that are fast and smooth to interact with, pan/zoom across map views of varying resolutions, and enable the display of various elements such as routes and POIs on highly customizable map views.

The HERE SDK consumes data from the [HERE Platform](https://www.here.com/products/platform) and follows modern design principles incorporating microservices and modularized components. Currently, the HERE SDK supports three platforms: Android, iOS and Flutter.

For an overview of the existing features, please check the _Developer Guide_ for the platform of your choice. Here you will also find numerous code snippets, detailed tutorials, the _API Reference_ and the latest _Release Notes_:

## More resources

- If you are interested to see a demo of the features the HERE SDK has to offer - or if you simply want to see all features in action, check the [HERE WeGo](https://www.here.com/products/wego) application. This app uses the same technology stack that empowers the HERE SDK.
- Alternatively, you can build and run the _Reference Application_ (available only for Flutter) which you can find as an [open-source project on GitHub](https://github.com/heremaps/here-sdk-ref-app-flutter). This app shows most features of the Navigate license including the features from the Explore license in an release-ready app with easy-to-understand UX flows and reusable UI assets.
