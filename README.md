In this repository you can find the [latest example apps](examples/latest) that show key features of the HERE SDK in ready-to-use applications.

## About the HERE SDK

The [HERE SDK](https://developer.here.com/products/here-sdk) enables you to build powerful location-aware applications. Explore maps that are fast and smooth to interact with, pan/zoom across map views of varying resolutions, and enable the display of various elements such as routes and POIs on highly customizable map views.

The HERE SDK consumes data from the [HERE Platform](https://www.here.com/products/platform) and follows modern design principles incorporating microservices and modularized components. Currently, the HERE SDK supports three platforms: Android, iOS and Flutter.

For an overview of the existing features, please check the _Developer Guide_ for the platform of your choice. Here you will also find numerous code snippets, detailed tutorials, the _API Reference_ and the latest _Release Notes_:

Most example apps contain a class named "XY-Example" where XY stands for the feature, which is in most cases equal to the name of the app. If you are looking for example code that shows how to use a certain HERE SDK feature, then please look for this class as it contains the most interesting parts. 

Note that the overall app architecture is kept as simple as possible to not shadow the parts in focus.

UI elements are mostly left out or kept minimal to not shadow the important parts of the code. Note that the HERE SDK itself does offer most APIs headless without UI.

## Example Apps for Older Versions
Above you can find the example app links for the _latest_ HERE SDK version. If you are looking for an older version, please check our [release page](https://github.com/heremaps/here-sdk-examples/releases) where you can download tagged older releases.

## What You Need to Execute the Example Apps
1. Acquire a set of credentials: Follow the steps from the [Developer Guide](https://www.here.com/docs/category/here-sdk) for your HERE SDK edition.
2. Download the latest HERE SDK package for your desired platform as shown in the _Developer Guide_.
3. Please refer to the minimum requirements and supported devices as listed in our _Developer Guide_.

### Get Started for Android
1. Copy the AAR file of the HERE SDK for Android to the example app's `app/libs` folder.
2. Open _Android Studio_ and sync the project.
3. To run the app, insert your HERE credentials (`accessKeyId` and `accessKeySecret`) in the `MainActivity.java` file.

### Get Started for iOS
1. Copy the `heresdk.framework` file of the HERE SDK for iOS to the example app's root folder.
2. To run the app, you need to add your HERE credentials (`accessKeyId` and `accessKeySecret`) to the `AppDelegate.swift` file of the project.

### Get Started for Flutter
1. Unzip the downloaded HERE SDK for Flutter _package_. This folder contains various files including documentation assets.
2. Inside you will also find a TAR file that contains the HERE SDK for Flutter _plugin_. It contains the iOS and Android native frameworks.
3. Now unzip the TAR file and rename the folder to 'here_sdk' and place it to the `plugins` folder inside the example app's directory. The folder structure should look like this: `hello_map/plugins/here_sdk`.
4. Set your HERE SDK credentials (accessKeyId and accessKeySecret) to the `main.dart` file of the project.
5. Start an Android emulator or an iOS simulator and execute `flutter run` from the app's directory - or run the app from within your IDE.

## More Resources

- If you are interested to see a demo of the features the HERE SDK has to offer - or if you simply want to see all features in action, check the [HERE WeGo](https://www.here.com/products/wego) application. This app uses the same technology stack that empowers the HERE SDK.
- Alternatively, you can build and run the _Reference Application_ (available only for Flutter) which you can find as an [open-source project on GitHub](https://github.com/heremaps/here-sdk-ref-app-flutter). This app shows most features of the _Navigate Edition_ including the features from the _Explore Edition_ in an release-ready app with easy-to-understand UX flows and reusable UI assets.
